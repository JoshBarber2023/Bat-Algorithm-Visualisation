# Bat Algorithm (BA) Visualisation ðŸ¦‡

This project demonstrates the Bat Algorithm (BA), a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the echolocation behavior of bats. In BA, a population of bats (solutions) move through the search space, adjusting their positions and velocities based on their previous best positions and the global best solution. The final result is visualized to showcase how the bats explore the solution space to converge to the optimal solution.

**Disclaimer:** Parts of this code and documentation were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT to accelerate development and improve clarity. AI assistance was used to help implement standard algorithms, handle plotting and animation, and structure explanations effectively.

## Overview

The Bat Algorithm (BA) is used to find the optimal solution to an optimization problem. The project visualizes the search process of the algorithm, simulating a swarm of bats moving through a 2D objective function space, adjusting their velocities and positions over time. The visual representation includes animated bats, their movement, and fitness levels.
